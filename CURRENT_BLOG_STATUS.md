## 🚫 Fallback Posts (Not Real - Just Code Placeholders)

The code has 3 fallback posts that are **NOT displayed** when Hygraph is connected:
- "The Five Essential Pillars of Technology Value Optimization"

These are only shown if Hygraph isn't configured. Since your Hygraph is connected, these don't appear.
