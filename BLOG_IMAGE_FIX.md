# ✅ Blog Image Display - FIXED

## What Was Fixed:

### Problem:
- Cover images from Hygraph were being fetched but **not displayed** on blog post pages
- Large empty space where image should appear

### Solution:
1. ✅ **Added cover image display** between header and article content
2. ✅ **Added OpenGraph image** for social media sharing
3. ✅ **Added Twitter card image** for better social previews

## What's Now Visible:

### SEO Benefits:
